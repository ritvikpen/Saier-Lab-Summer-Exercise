1.  Print the gene name (column Locus) and size (column: Length) of the smallest protein in the genome.

	Locus: trpL	Length: 14
	Locus: pheM	Length: 14

2.  Print the gene name (column Locus) and size (column: Length) of the largest protein in the genome.

	Locus: yeeJ	Length: 2358

3.  Print the gene name (column Locus), positions (columns Start and Stop) and strand (column Strand) of the 15th to 20th genes in the order they  appear in the chromosome.

	Locus:		Start:		Stop:		Strand:
	insL1		15445		16557		+
	hokC		16751		16903		-
	mokC		16751		16960		-
	nhaA		17489		18655		+
	nhaR		18715		19620		+
	insB1		19811		20314		-

4.  Print the gene name, strand, positions of all genes sorted by:
      a) Strand, left position  
		output-4a.tsv
      b) Strand, size and left position (column Start).
		output-4b.tsv
      NOTE: This is sorting by more than one column (very useful!).

5.  How many different enzymes are there in the genome (use column Protein_name)?
	84  

6.  How many enzymes of each type are there? For simplicity, assume that if the enzyme name is not identical between two enzymes, they belong different types.
	??

7.  How many transporters are there in the genome (use column Protein_name)?
	389

8.  What is the name, strand and length of largest transporter in the genome?
	Name:		Strand:		Length:
	ypjA		-		1526

9.  What is the name, strand and length of shortest transporter?
	Name:		Strand:		Length:
	kdpF		-		29

10. How many operons (larger than 2 genes) are there in the genome?
      NOTE: use the first 3 letters of the gene name (column Locus) to identify operons. Assume that if two genes share the first 3 letters of the gene name, they belong to the same operon.
	638

11. What is the largest operon in the genome?
	ins with 56 genes

12. a) How many ABC transporters are there in the genome (use column Protein_name)?
		172
    b) How many are there in the reverse and forward strands?
		102 in reverse and 70 in forward
    c) What are the largest and smallest ABC transporters in each strand? 
		Forward:
